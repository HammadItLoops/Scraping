The vision for this web site is to provide a resource for the Church regarding its rich Hebraic heritage by promoting Jewish literacy among all those who claim Jesus Christ as their Lord.  I believe this is important today for many reasons, but especially because many people in the church today are unaware of the inherent Jewishness of their heritage, and sadly this reflects in many misinterpretations regarding the Scriptures. Remember: Jesus was (and is) a Jew, and to be a follower of Him implies learning about the Jewish people -- their culture, their language, and their way of understanding the Scriptures. Moreover, in the olam habah, the world to come, we will all give homage to a Jewish Lord and Jewish Savior! Why not get a head start and begin learning the "language of the kingdom?"Studying biblical Hebrew and Jewish heritage will give you the correct context for reading the B'rit Chadashah (New Testament) by equipping you to comprehend the implications of the Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim (the Tanakh or Old Testament).

IntroductionTypes of blessingsFree Study Cards
Daily Hebrew Berachot
Jewish tradition requires that we personally bless the LORD for each detail of our daily experience. Such a requirement -- if not practiced legalistically -- surely points to a deep inward appreciation for the good things God personally provides for us throughout each day. These sample Hebrew blessings vocalize our gratitude to God for His daily provision and care:
Upon ArisingAsher Yatzar Blessing When BathingBlessing for SalvationOffering PraiseGetting your FocusSetting your Attitude Fighting against EvilWearing TzitzitWearing TefillinMorning BlessingWhen Eating BreadWhen Drinking WineGeneral Blessing over Food

Printer-Friendly PDF Versions!Blessing for our BurdensGod's Sovereignty
Messianic Berachot
Messianic blessings are recited in Hebrew with the intent of remaining true to the Jewish identity of Yeshua as the Mashiach of Israel and Savior of the world. Often these blessings are found in various Messianic Siddurim (prayer books), though (unlike traditional Judaism) there is no consensus on each individual blessing's content. Nonethess, reciting these blessings with the appropriate kavannah (intention) can often help express the heart of those who identify themselves as Jewish believers in Jesus.

Shabbat Berachot
Shabbat begins at sunset on Friday evening and ends Saturday night when three stars are visible in the sky. On Shabbat Jews remember that God created the world and then rested from His labors. Shabbat is considered the most important of the Jewish holidays -- even more important than Yom Kippur or the other High Holidays. This is a special day to be marked by three qualities: rest (menuchah), holiness (kedushah), and joy (oneg).

Of course Hebrew blessings are also recited as part of synagogue services. These blessings are embedded within the normal synagogue liturgy, and many are part of the Hebrew prayer services (Shacarit, Minchah, and Ma'ariv services).

Miscellaneous Berachot
There are many other blessings prescribed by Jewish tradition to help us remember the goodness of God and to practice our gratitude before Him. Some of these are spontaneously uttered praises to God for evidence of His daily care; some of these are special words said on special occasions; and some are more formalized cadences uttered for ritualistic observances:

Biblical Berachot
Some berachot come directly from the pages of the Scriptures themselves, including many from Tehillim (Psalms). Some of these blessings have become embedded in various Jewish siddurim.

Jewish Prayer Services
Tefillot, Siddur, Shemoneh Esrei
The word "Jew" comes from Judah, a name that means "praised" which is derived from the shoresh yadah, meaning (in the Hiphil) to give thanks, to laud, to praise. A true Jew, then, is one who lives in a praiseworthy attitude and manner according to God's standards.
Section Map
Prayer and praise make up the heart of the true Jew. Over the many centuries, Jews have developed countless prayers and blessings to God.Note that Jewish prayer is not confined to services and holidays, since it is considered daily communion with God. Nor is prayer confined to the synagogue, since there are many prayers and blessings intended to be said by the individual in the home.
Introduction - An overview of the Jewish view of prayer and praise.
The Siddur - Understanding the Jewish Prayerbook.
Jewish Prayer Services - The morning, afternoon, and evening prayer services, including links to the common prayers and blessings (in Hebrew).
The Weekday Amidah - The Shemoneh Esrei or weekday Amidah is provided here online.
The LORD's Prayer - The model prayer Yeshua taught His disciples.
Kaddish -  "Sanctification," a prayer of praise recited by mourners.
Perek Yomi Tehillim - Daily readings from the book of Psalms.
Online Shabbat Siddur - a suggested order of service for Messianic Jews.

The Hebrew Scriptures -
Printer-Friendly Version
Kitvei HaKodesh - כִּתְבֵי הַקּדֶשׁ
The Hebrew Bible is called the Tanakh (sometimes transliterated as Tanach in English), an acronym for Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim (note the gerashayim in the Hebrew acronym תנ״ך‎). The Tanakh is divided into three main sections, as follows:
Torah(Teaching)
Nevi'im(Prophets)
Ketuvim(Writings)
Download a printable document listing the books of the Bible in Hebrew:
Download the PDF File
Three Divisions of Tanakh
Torah(Teaching)
The first five books of Moses. The actual Torah itself is referred to as the Sefer Torah, or sacred Torah scroll. The Chumash is a book form of the Torah, usually subdivided into 54 smaller literary units called parashiot (the name of each parashah comes from a key word of the section). The word Torah is better understood as "teaching" or "understanding" rather than "law."(Torah makes the "t" of Tanakh).
Nevi'im(Prophets)
The prophetical books are subdivided into two parts: Four books of the "Former" prophets and 15 books of the "Latter" prophets (Nevi'im makes the "n" of Tanakh).
Ketuvim(Writings)
Assorted sacred writings, including Psalms, Proverbs, and some historical books. There are 12 books in this division of the Tanakh (Ketuvim makes the "k(h)" of Tanakh).
Notes:
Some Jews refer to the entire Hebrew Bible (Kitvei HaKodesh) simply as the Torah -- without making the distinction of the divisions shown above.
Though the Christian Old Testament is the result of the canonization of the Jewish scriptures, the order of the books in the Tanakh is not identical to the Christian Old Testament (though content is the same), and chapter and verse references are not always identical between the Old Testament and the Tanakh.
Some Jews refer to the Torah and Nakh - referring to the Nevi'im and Ketuvim as separate from written Torah (i.e., Nakh).
Traditionally, weekly Torah readings (called parashiyot) of the entire Torah are completed during one year. Weekly Nevi'im readings are known as haftarah.
Most Jews put the Oral Law (Talmud) and the halakhah (Rabbinic rulings) on the same level as the written Torah.
The Thirteen Principles of Faith
Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) is considered by many Jews to be the most important medieval sage. Influenced by Thomas Aquinas and Avicenna, Maimonides sought to systematize the Jewish faith along scholastic lines. His Shloshah-Asar Ikkarim, or Thirteen Principles of the faith, is still widely recited as a sort of Jewish credo among many orthodox Jews.

The B'rit Chadashah
The New Testament is called the B'rit Chadashah in Hebrew (בְּרִית חֲדָשָׁה), meaning "New Covenant" (the word B'rit means "covenant" and Chadashah means "new"). Like the Tanakh, it can be divided into three main parts: Gospels/Acts (corresponding to Torah), Letters (corresponding to Ketuvim), and Revelation (corresponding to Nevi'im):
Besorat HaGe'ulah(Good News of Redemption)
Iggerot(Letters)
Hitgallut(Revelation)

B'rit Chadashah: Three Main Divisions
Like the Tanakh, the B'rit Chadashah can be divided into three main parts: Gospels/Acts (corresponding to Torah), Letters (corresponding to Ketuvim), and Revelation (corresponding to Nevi'im):
Besorat HaGe'ulah[Gospels]
The four portraits of the Messiah of Israel as given by His messengers (Luke/Acts may be considered as a unit). Besorah means "good news" and Ge'ulah means "redemption."
Iggerot[Letters]
Eight "general" letters to Messianic Jewish communities and thirteen letters from Paul, the emissary to the Gentiles. The word Iggeret (pl. Iggerot) means "letter."
Hitgallut[Revelation]
The revelation of Yeshua the Messiah as given to His emissary Yochanan (John). The word Hitgallut means "revelation" or "unveiling" (sometimes the word Chazon ("vision") is used instead).
b'khol-zot lanu rak-elohim echad, hu avi-'ad, asher mimenu hakol v'lo anachnu,v'adon echad Yeshua hamashiach, asher hakol al-yado, v'al-yado gam-anachnu.
Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist,and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.1 Corinthians 8:6
Notes:
Just as there were 400 years of silence before Adonai sent Moses to deliver Israel from her bondage to Pharaoh, so there were 400 of years of silence before Adonai sent His own Son, Yeshua the Messiah, to utterly deliver Israel from her ultimate bondage to sin and death. Moses himself foretold of the coming of the Messiah (see Deuteronomy 18:18).
Some Messianic believers think that the order of the B'rit Chadashah books should be reworked so that the "Hebrew epistles" (i.e., the eight letters to the Messianic communities) appear before the Pauline letters. Why? Because the message of the Good News of Redemption is "to the Jew first, and also to the Greek," as Paul himself notes in the letter to the Romans (Romans 1:16, 2:10).
The New Testament was originally written in (Koine) Greek, not Hebrew. There are several Hebrew New Testaments that have been translated from Greek. This site relies upon the Hebrew New Testament (The Society For Distributing Hebrew Scriptures, 1886/1999) and The Hebrew New Testament (Trinitarian Bible Society, 1966/1998).

Hebrew Names of God -
Shemot Ha-Elohim
Almighty God graciously chose to reveal His Name (i.e., His character and presence by means of His acts and deeds) to the world through the Jewish people. Through the ancient Hebrew Patriarchs, through the great deliverance God effected by means of His servant Moses, through the eloquent oracles and admonitions of the Hebrew prophets, and most especially through the manifestation of the Mashiach Yeshua: in all these ways God has revealed His Name. In fact, the Scriptures make it clear that the name of Yeshua is so vital to our correct apprehension of reality that without it we are literally lost, since we are told "there is no other name by means of which it is necessary for us to be saved" (Acts 4:12).

Names Revealed in the Brit Chadashah
The extant manuscripts of the Brit Chadashah are written in Koine Greek, though undoubtedly the Hebraic mindset permeates the writings, since all of its authors were first century Torah-observant Jews who were intimately acquainted with the Tanakh (as was the Mashiach Yeshua, of course). External evidence that Matthew originally wrote his Gospel in Hebrew reaches as far back as Papias of Hierapolis, of the second century CE. Eusebius quoted Papias: "Matthew collected the oracles in the Hebrew language" (The Ecclesiastical History, III, XXXIX, 16). This is corroborated later in the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 116a), the Jerusalem Talmud (Shabbat 15c), as well as the Tosefta (Shabbat 13:5), where debate rages concerning the destruction of the scrolls of the Brit Chadashah: Should they be burned since they contain the divine Name (i.e., YHVH)? This debate clearly documents that the gospel was extant in Hebrew in early church history.By correlating direct and indirect quotations of the Tanakh (and LXX) as well as by contextualizing the Greek constructions into their Hebrew counterparts, translators of the New Testament into Hebrew (such as F. Delitzsch, Salkinson and Ginsburg) are able to infer Hebrew equivalents. In some cases this is straightforward: the Title "First and the Last" occurs both in the Tanakh and in the Brit Chadashah. In other cases, however, contextualization is the key: the word Theos (1,000 times), Kurios (600 times), Christ (555 times), and so on, all derive their meaning from the overarching context of Jewish history, culture and collective hermeneutic.

The Jewish Holidays
The Appointed Times of the LORD...
This section of the site provides information about the most significant mo'edim (or "appointed times") that are important to Jews all over the world.  All of the Biblical mo'edim are prophetic and reveal great truth about the plans and counsel of the LORD God of Israel. Therefore they are also called "the feasts of the LORD" (××Ö¹×¢×× ××××).Note: For Jews living outside Israel, major Jewish holidays (except for Yom Kippur) are often observed for an additional day (called yom tov sheni).  [more]
Introduction
section map
The feasts and holidays of the LORD are part of the larger mosaic of Jewish time that expresses the corporate life cycle of Jews all over the world.
Introduction to the Jewish Calendar (start here)
A brief overview of the Eight Annual Feasts given to Israel
The Holidays: Weekly, Monthly, Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Fast Days, Israeli
The Jewish Day
Since the Torah's day (××× ××ª××¨×) begins at sundown, you must remember that a given holiday actually begins on the night before the day listed in a Jewish calendar. For example, Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Memorial Day) occurs on Nisan 27, which actually begins after sundown, Nisan 26:
Thus a given Jewish holiday spans two days on our Gregorian calendar. Most Jewish calendars do not indicate the previous night as part of the holiday. Observance of a holiday begins at sundown on the day before it is listed in the calendar!
In the example above, Yom HaShoah (×× ××©×××) is observed both on Thursday the 5th (after sundown) and Friday the 6th (during daylight hours). Note that if a given holiday were to occur on a Sabbath, it would be moved to the previous Thursday on the calendar. For example, if Nisan 27 happened to begin on Friday at sundown, it would be moved to Nisan 26. Accessing a current Jewish calendar is essential to observing the mo'edim!
The Jewish Week
The Torah's week (×©×××¢ ××ª××¨×) begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday (Shabbat). The Jewish sages have argued that Shabbat is the most important of the mo'edim, since it is explicitly commanded to be observed in the Aseret HaDiberot (Ten Commandments).
The Sabbath foreshadows the olam habah (world to come) and our restored dignity as children of the New Covenant.
Weekly Torah Readings are considered appointments with the Bat Kol, the Voice of the LORD.
The Jewish Month
The Torah's month (××××© ××ª××¨×) is based on the lunar cycle, and Rosh ha'Chodesh ("the Head of the Month") symbolizes the renewal of the new moon (month), when the moon appears as a sliver in the sky.  Rosh Chodesh is marked by special liturgy.
Rosh Chodesh (×¨××©× ×××©×) symbolizes renewal and restoration. Just as the moon wanes and disappears at the end of each month, but returns and waxes again to fullness, so we suffer until the return of our beloved Mashiach Yeshua, who will restore the glory of God fully upon the earth.
The Spring Holidays
Spring is the start of the Biblical Year and is marked by two of the Shelosh Regalim (three annual pilgrimage festivals): Pesach (Passover) and Shavuot (Pentecost). Shavuot is held seven weeks (or fifty days) following the morning after Pesach.
The spring holidays (××× ×××××) reveal the first coming of Yeshua (as Mashiach ben Yosef) and provide a portrait of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Messiah: Yeshua was crucified on erev Pesach (during the time of the sacrifice of the Passover lambs), buried during Chag Hamotzi (the festival of Unleavened Bread), and was resurrected from the dead on Yom Habikkurim (the Day of Firstfruits). Fifty days after Passover, on the climactic holiday of Shavuot (i.e., the feast of Pentecost), the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) fell on the believers in fulfillment of the promise given by our Lord.  Note both that the giving of the Holy Spirit occurred precisely according to the calendar countdown given in the Torah (Lev. 23:15-16) and that it occurred after the cross of Yeshua -- just as our Messiah foretold (Acts 1:6-8, Acts 2:1-4). This proves that the feasts of the LORD (××Ö¹×¢×× ××××) were not abolished after the crucifixion of the Lord. The meaning of the gospel is prefigured and told in the holidays given in the Torah. See Luke 24:27, 24:44; John 5:46; Acts 26:22, etc.The Spring Holidays:
Rosh Chodashim - The Biblical New Year [Nisan 1]
Preparing for Passover - Spring Cleaning
Vernal Equinox - Birkat HaChamah
Shabbat HaGadol - The Shabbat preceding Passover
Ta'anit Bechorim - Fast of the firstborn son [Nisan 14]
Bedikat Chametz - The Search for Chametz [Nisan 14]
Passover (Pesach) - Celebration of freedom (Major Holiday)
The Passover Seder [Nisan 15 (evening of the 14th)]
Unleavened Bread (Chag HaMatzot) - Messiah's Burial [Nisan 15-22]
Sefirat HaOmer - Counting the Omer [Nisan 16- Sivan 5]; the countdown to Shavu'ot.
The Day of Firstfruits (Yom HaBikkurim) - Messiah's Resurrection; [Nisan 17]
Yom HaShoah - Holocaust Memorial Day [Nisan 27]
Yom Hazikaron - Israel Memorial Day [Iyyar 4th]
Yom Ha'atzma'ut - Israel Independence Day [Iyyar 5th]
Herzl Day - Honoring the Zionist leader Theodor Herzl [Iyyar 10th]
Lag B'Omer - 33rd day of the Omer [Iyyar 18]
Mem B'Omer - Holiday of the Ascension [Iyyar 25]
Yom Yerushalayim - Jerusalem Reunification Day [Iyyar 28th]
Pentecost (Shavuot; Chag HaBikkurim) - The giving of the Torah at Sinai and the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) to the Church at Zion [Sivan 6-7] (Major Holiday)
The Summer Holidays
In the summer there occurs a three week period of mourning that begins with the Fast of Tammuz and ends with tragic holiday of Tishah B'Av. The last nine days of this three week period (i.e., from Av 1 until Av 9th) are days of increased mourning. After this somber time, however, the romantic holiday of Tu B'Av, the 15th of Av occurs. Originally a post-biblical day of joy, the 15th of Av served as a matchmaking day for unmarried women in the Second Temple period.
The summer holidays (××× ××§××¥) conclude with the 30 days of the month of Elul, a yearly season of teshuvah (repentance) that anticipates Rosh Hashanah and the fall holidays. The days of Elul are combined with the first ten days of the month of Tishri to create the Forty Days of Teshuvah (××¨××¢×× ××× ×ª×©×××) that culminate with the holy day of Yom Kippur.
The summer holidays help us prepare for the second coming of the Messiah:The Summer Holidays:
Fast of the 17th of Tammuz - Start of the three weeks of sorrow [Tammuz 17]
Tish'ah B'Av (Summer) Last day of the three weeks of sorrow [Av 9]
Tu B'Av - Harvest and Romance [Av 15]
Elul and Selichot - Preparing for teshuvah and the fall holidays
The Fall Holidays
The Jewish civil year begins in the fall, though the Biblical year begins in spring (Exod. 12:2). Preparations for the fall holidays begin with a thirty day period of teshuvah (repentance) during the (late summer) month of Elul. The following ten days begin with the Feast of Trumpets (i.e., Rosh Hashanah, on Tishri 1) and end with the Day of Atonement (i.e., Yom Kippur, on Tishri 10). These first ten days of the new year are called the "Ten Days of Awe" (i.e., aseret ye'mei teshuvah: ×¢Ö²×©×Ö¶×¨Ö¶×ª ×Ö°×Öµ× ×ªÖ¼Ö°×©××Ö¼×Ö¸×), or simply the Jewish "High Holidays." Just five days after the solemn time of Yom Kippur begins the joyous week-long festival of Sukkot ("Tabernacles"), which is immediately followed by the celebration of Simchat Torah.
The fall holidays (××× ××¡×ª××) prophetically indicate the great Day of the LORD (××Ö¹×Ö¾×Ö°××Ö¸×), the second coming of Yeshua, the great national turning of the Jewish people, and the establishment of the reign of the Messiah over the earth during the Millennial Kingdom.The Fall Holidays:
Elul and Selichot - preparing for the high holidays (later summer)
The Day of Creation - [Elul 25]
Yamim Nora'im (Days of Awe):
Rosh Hashanah / Yom Teru'ah -  The Day of Judgment [Tishri 1]
Tzom Gedaliah - Fast day [Tishri 3]
Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) - Israel's national salvation [Tishri 10]
3.  Tabernacles (Sukkot) - The world to come (Major Holiday) [Tishri 15-21]
Hoshana Rabba - The seventh day of Sukkot [Tishri 21]
Shemini Atzeret -  The 8th day of assembly following Sukkot [Tishri 22]
Simchat Torah - Celebration of the giving of the Torah [Tishri 23]
Chanukah (Dedication) - late fall/early winter: Victory; [Kislev 25 - Tevet 3]
Note that two other dates are significant during this season:
Kristallnacht Remembrance: the "Night of Broken Glass" [Cheshvan 15, the date Nov. 9th, 1938 - the first great pogrom of the Nazis in Germany]
The Balfour Declaration - [Cheshvan 17, the date when the British government agreed to a Jewish homeland in 1917. Note that Cheshvan 17 is also the date traditionally associated with start of the great mabbul, the flood of Noah]
The Winter Holidays
The winter holidays (××× ××××¨×£) remember special times when God acted on behalf of His people so that they would triumph over their enemies, and therefore they prophetically picture the final victory in the world to come.
The winter holidays help us anticipate the final victory to come...The Winter Holidays:
Chanukah (Dedication) [Kislev 25 - Tevet 3]
Christmas: Dec. 25th (Hebrew date varies)
Secular New Year: Jan. 1st (Hebrew date varies)
Asarah B'Tevet [Tevet 10]
Tu B'Shevat [Shevat 15] - The New Year for trees
International Holocaust Remembrance Day (Jan. 27th)
The Fast of Esther [Adar 13]
Purim (Lots) [Adar 14]
National Holidays of Israel
Since the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel has established four new national holidays (××× ××©×¨××), three of which occur in the month of Iyyar (Apr/May):
Yom HaShoah - Holocaust Memorial Day [Nisan 27]
Yom Hazikaron - Israel Memorial Day [Iyyar 4th]
Yom Ha'atzmaut - Israel Independence Day [Iyyar 5th]
Herzl Day - Honoring the Zionist leader Theodor Herzl [Iyyar 10th]
Yom Yerushalayim - Jerusalem Reunification Day [Iyyar 28th]
Fast Days of the Year
In addition to Yom Kippur, the Talmud (Tractate Rosh Hashana 18b) discusses four fast days (××× ×¦××) based on Zechariah 8:19 that commemorate the destruction of the First and Second Temples and the exile of the Jewish People from their homeland. In addition, two other fast days are mentioned in the Rabbinical literature, yielding a total of six prescribed fasts (seven if Yom Kippur is included).

Clear Thinking
Many of the problems we experience in our lives, both individually and corporately, result from a lack of clarity in our thinking about what is real, true, and essential. It is rare indeed to find a person who takes the time to think clearly about things. Too often our fast-paced, over-stimulated, jacked-up society simply acts like a pack of Pavlovian dogs responding to the bells and whistles of the postmodern "techno culture" rather than as rational agents created in the image and likeness of God.
It doesn't have to be that way. We can break free of the hypnotic conformity that surrounds us if we are willing to acquire the skill of intelligently listening to the thoughts that are inside our heads - and inside the heads of others in our society. These thoughts, of course, evidence themselves as decisions, which lead to actions, which lead to character formation (inward) and cultural expression (outward).This section of the site is devoted to the appreciation of clear thinking. With the aid of clear thinking and the impartation of wisdom from God, we can be better equipped to "rightly divide the word of truth" and thereby know the truth, which, as the Master has said, will set us free.

Kabbalah?Role of Torah
The Great CommandmentUnderstanding your heart's greatest need...
Read more >
Both Moses and Yeshua taught that the "great commandment" of Torah is to love God with all of our being.  Nothing is more important, and nothing better expresses the essential duty of our lives.  In this exploratory article, I consider how loving God is a call to awaken to beauty, mystery, holiness, and peace. It's an invitation to be radically made whole, set free from fear and despair.  The great commandment is to open your heart to receive God's love and to learn to love...
Between Heaven and HellThe Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus...
Read more >
The parable of the "Rich man and Lazarus" (Luke 16:19-31) is one of the most sobering and consequential of the Scriptures. Yeshua's concise and brilliant story ranges over the issues of life and death and of our ultimate destiny beyond the grave. It answers perennial questions about where people go when they die, and it gives counsel about how to plan for the inevitability of judgment. It forewarns of the terrifying prospect of hell and eternal torment while it comforts those who seek heavenly blessing and eternal life.
Angry at God? "Forgiving God" for the tragedy of life
Read more >
We "forgive" God by letting go of our (usually subconscious) demands to be something other than what we are, and that means giving up hard feelings of disappointment, bitterness, and rage over things we cannot change. We must abandon the need to "justify our existence" on our own terms. In that sense "forgiving God" is a way of forgiving ourselves, since holding on to our hurts, either by self-pity or blaming others, chains the pain to our hearts, enslaving us to despair.
The Gospel of SurrenderReflections on the cost of discipleship...
Read more >
Yeshua solemnly warned those who professed faith: "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness'" (Matt. 7:21-23). Despite the practice and profession of their faith, these people were strangers to God... They had a false sense of assurance, believing that they were "serving God" while they really were not...  So the essential question here is whether Yeshua truly knows you. You may know a lot about God, religion, spirituality, and yet you may remain unknown by him... So where do you find life? What are you loving? Where are you going?
Wounds of LonelinessYearning of the heart...
Read more >
The late Henri Nouwen said that there are two great fears (or wounds) that we all face. The first is the fear that we were not wanted at the time of our birth into this world, and the second is that we will not be wanted at the time of our death. If you carry a wound of abandonment within your heart - if you live in dread over your worth as a human being, seriously wondering whether it would have been better had you never been born, then you know the taste of hell itself - the emotional prison of feeling lost, defective, rejected, shameful - unable to love or to be loved...
The Language of PainKnowing God in our Sorrow and Hope...
Read more >
A pain-free life is not necessarily a sign of blessing, of course, since it might indicate that the person is no longer being "educated for eternity," and therefore that God no longer talks to him anymore. This is one way to understand the tragic irony of why the wicked prosper in this world, for they shall have received their reward here, but nothing in the world to come (Matt. 6:5; Job 27:8).  On the other hand, pain can "goad" the soul to draw near to God for healing, which is the essential and consummate blessing, after all...
The Torah of the Messiah... Are you "Yeshua Observant?
Read more >
When was the last time you sacrificed a lamb for your Passover seder? Or went to a religious service to offer a bullock for the guilt of your sin? Have you been careful to make pilgrimage three times a year to the Holy Temple to appear before the Lord as the Torah demands? Questions like these seem strange in light of the revelation we have in Yeshua our Messiah concerning the meaning of salvation. In this article (and audio podcast) I sort through some of the tensions we might experience when we consider whether Christians are required to follow the law of Moses or whether there is another way in light of the ministry of Yeshua the Messiah.  I hope you will find it helpful.
Matters of First ImportanceThe Gospel Message According to Paul...
Read more >
The Apostle Paul summarized the message of the gospel by means of four empirical propositions, namely: 1) that Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures; 2) that he was buried; 3) that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures; and 4) that he was seen alive by various eyewitnesses after his death (see 1 Cor. 15:1-8).  Paul went on to argue that the reality of the resurrection is the center of salvation, for if Yeshua had not been raised from the dead, his repeated declarations that he would suffer, die, and come back to life would be untrue, and therefore we would still be captive to our sins. The great fact that Yeshua was indeed raised from the dead, however, demonstrates that his mission to redeem humanity was successful, and that death has been "swallowed up" by means of his victory over the curse of sin (1 Cor. 15:36).  This is the core message that Paul regarded as being of "first importance" and essential to salvation.
Suffering and ParadoxThe Already-not-Yet of our Hope...
Read more >
There is a gap between the "real" and the "ideal," between our present sense of exile and our hope that one day we will be in our heavenly home; there is an inherent and ongoing dualism we experience as we sojourn through our days. On the one hand, if we make time to reflect on what is "real," we will eventually encounter the "Parmenidean" realm of "being," that is, the totality of sheer existence, the inescapable presence that surrounds and pervades any "thing" whatsoever: the "ground" of existence; the timeless sense of unity, perfection, and so on. The heart's response to this awareness is humble acceptance - to surrender to all that is -- in wonder over the miracle of consciousness and the sheer gift of life itself. The "real" is what "is" and that is a monolithic mystery...
Nomos and Torah...Does "law" adequately translate the idea of "Torah"?
Read more >
A source of potential confusion for translators of the Greek New Testament concerns how the word "nomos" (Î½á½¹Î¼Î¿Ï), which is often simply translated as "law," is to be understood.  Does "nomos" always refer to the law code of Moses or does it perhaps more generally refer to the "Old Testament"?  Does it go beyond the idea of a imperative to include general principles, such as the "law of sin and death"?  Of particular importance is how are we to distinguish between the use of nomos as "law" as opposed to various other words used in the Hebrew text to indicate obligation. Perhaps most generally, is it right to substitute the idea of "Torah" for the word "nomos" (and vice-versa) when we translate and read the New Testament?
Is Christianity anti-Jewish?A brief look at Interpretative Factors...
Read more >
Many of today's church leaders seem to hold views about ethnic Israel that express institutionalized prejudice and an "anti-Jewish" bias. But how did the church get so far removed from the Jewish roots of the faith?  Is Christianity essentially anti-Jewish in its perspective?This brief article surveys the history of an interpretation method that regularly gives rise to the idea that the Christian church is "reconsituted" or "completed" Israel.
Israel and the ChurchWhat's the Relationship?
When studying the Jewish roots of Christianity, certain questions often arise regarding the nature of the "Church," the nature of "Israel," and the relationship between them. Do Gentile Christians become "Jewish" on account of their relationship to Jesus?  Does the "Church" somehow replace the Jewish people in God's plan as the "new Israel"?  Exactly how should we understand the relationship between the Church and Israel?

Hermeneutics of SufferingAn Existential Problem of Meaning...
Read more >
Philosophically considered, suffering is a problem of meaning, since without a coherent narrative of why we suffer, our sense of order, intelligibility, and even our very sanity may be threatened. The problem of suffering is therefore the problem of interpreting our life experiences without succumbing to the threat of nihilism and despair. Faith justifies our struggle, giving it meaning, purpose, and a glorious end; an honest conviction must give voice to our anguish and yet still be able to say "yes" to the validity and significance of hope itself.
The Liberty of the GospelThe Apostle Paul and the Law of Moses...
Read more >
One of the earliest challenges to the integrity of the gospel message came from certain "false brethren" who went about teaching Gentile followers of Yeshua to "keep the law" of Moses.  Apparently Paul had to deal with this challenge repeatedly during his years of ministry, but when the apostle Peter himself seemed to concede to this idea by disassociating with Gentile believers in Atioch, Paul publicly rebuked him for turning away from the essential truth of salvation. Paul's correction of Peter provided him with an opportunity to clarify the meaning of the gospel and to settle the question of whether believers in Yeshua were in fact required to keep the law of Moses. Paul's answer constitutes the substance of the Book of Galatians.
A Willful Ignorance...The Crowd and Insensate Culture
Read more >
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was surrounded by the atrocious evil of Nazi Germany, regarded stupidity as more dangerous than outright evil, since stupidity is a type of irrationality, a chosen ignorance of what is real and true. Against such willed ignorance we are often defenseless, since any reasoning that appeals to transcendental moral truth finds no traction, carries no weight, and has no effect.  The devil, then, seeks first of all to stupefy people, that is, to drug them or flatter and persuade them to think that there is no need to engage in serious thinking or to humbly question their assumptions...
Sickness Unto Life...The Propaedeutic of Faith
Read more >
Death is an inevitable aspect of life and therefore it constitutes the central question of our existence in this world. Pleasures, wealth, and worldly ambition do not satisfy us but are like chasing after the wind -- they are "havel havalim" (×Ö²×Öµ× ×Ö²×Ö¸×Ö´××), the utmost of vanities, as King Solomon said long before the French existentialists expressed the same idea (Eccl 1:2). We live in a world of constant flux wherein ha'kol over (××× ×¢×××¨), "everything passes" and nothing abides.  In light of this, can we find healing from the lethality of existence?
The Torah of Death and LifeParadox and Broken Dreams...
Read more >
Why does God want us to face the truth about death? Why does Moses ask God to teach us to "number of our days?" (Psalm 90:12). The reason is that by nature people deny the reality of death - they hide their eyes from it, ignore it, and pretend it's not there - so they can continue to live under the illusion that they are in control of their lives, that they are the center, that they are immoral little "gods." Death threatens the ego and humbles us to confess the truth about life, namely that we are not in control, that we cannot choose to be immortals, that we do not have power to exist in ourselves, and therefore we need life from a different source - spiritual life - wherein we receive a new identity a new being found in relation to God.
Withstanding Evil DaysTrusting God in the Darkness...
Read more >
When we encounter horrific evil, it is natural for us to groan and lament, to feel indignation and outrage, and to cry out for divine justice and even retributionâ¦ As people of faith in the LORD, we profoundly feel the tension between affirming both that our loving Creator sustains all things by the word of his power (Deut. 32:4; Psalm 33:4; Col. 1:16-17, Heb. 1:3, etc.) and yet acknowledging that the ongoing depravity of human beings yields untold suffering, heartache, and pain in this world. This brief artcile considers some of the dialectical tensions of having faith in God in a dark world...
Faith and LonelinessUnderstanding the Existential Tensions...
Read more >
There is an inherent dualism in our reflective consciousness wherein we seek an eternal happiness and ultimate good that transcends anything that may be found in this temporal world. Our faith confesses that reality itself is "two-tiered," corresponding to two different realms of existence, namely, an "upper realm" of the immaterial and spiritual (i.e., heaven) and a "lower realm" of the material and physical (i.e., the natural universe). Upon reflection we may sometimes feel lonely and bewildered in this duality, not knowing how to "mediate" or bring together the opposite poles of our experience...
Mystery and HumilityAbiding in the Divine Connection...
Read more >
Though it is important to guard our sincere convictions and to be passionate about what we believe, we must nevertheless be careful to walk in humility before the mystery of life...  After all, much is inscrutable to us, much is beyond our understanding, and therefore, if we are honest, we should be reverent before the "sacred secrecy" of everything. The humble person freely confesses that they "walk by faith, not by sight"--  by hearing the Word of God and heeding what the Spirit of God is saying to the heart...
Hope in Troubled TimesCourage in the End of Days...
Read more >
According to many of the sages, the time immediately preceding the appearance of the Messiah will be a time of testing (nisayon) in which the world will undergo various forms of tribulation, called chevlei Mashiach (×Ö¶×Ö°×Öµ× ×Ö·×Ö¼Ö¸×©×Ö´××Ö·) - the "birth pangs of the Messiah."  Some say the birth pangs are to last for 70 years, with the last 7 years being the most intense period of tribulation -- called the "Time of Jacob's Trouble" / ×¢Öµ×ªÖ¾×¦Ö¸×¨Ö¸× ×Ö´×× ×Ö°×Ö·×¢Ö²×§× (Jer. 30:7). The climax of the Great Tribulation is called the great "Day of the LORD" (××Ö¹×Ö¾×××× ×Ö·×Ö¼Ö¸××Ö¹×) which represents God's wrath poured out upon a rebellious world system.
Torah of the VineLiving in the Divine Connection...
The Word of God speaks: "If anyone does not live in Me, he is cast off as a branch, and withers..." (John 15:6). We find life only as we remain connected to the Source and Conduit of life, who is the Messiah, the Savior and LORD. True life grows out a heart connection with Yeshua, and without that connection our lives become vain and yield no eternal significance (John 15:5).

The Sign of the Sabbath...Is Sunday the "New Sabbath" day?
How important is the idea of the Sabbath day to you? Are you a Christian who goes to Church on Sunday, believing this is the "Lord's Day?"  If so, please prayerfully consider the linked article, which hopefully will challenge some of your assumptions and help you better discern the truth of the Scriptures...

Theology of SufferingConsidering the groan of creation...
How we answer the question of why we suffer depends on how we interpret its meaning and its potential purpose in our lives. Does God orchestrate suffering for our ultimate good, as part of his plan for our lives, or does God respond to our suffering and seek to heal us from its influence? In other words, should we accept suffering as "inside" God's master plan for our lives, or somehow "outside" of that plan?

To the Jew First... Remembering God's Heart for Zion
Christians who ignore their spiritual debt to the Jewish people and write them off as "unreachable" because of "God's sovereign purposes" are like Pontius Pilate who vainly washed his hands of the guilt he richly warranted... So-called pastors or teachers who deny God's unconditional promises given to Israel need to rethink whether they are serving the LORD God of Israel - or mere men (Gal. 1:10).

Interpretation and TraditionAssumptions that affect our faith...

Do you have a Jewish heart?Taking hold of your identity in Messiah....
It should be obvious that those who claim to worship "Jesus Christ" (i.e., Yeshua the Messiah of Israel) will necessarily have a heart for the Jewish people - and hopefully a desire to learn of the roots of their faith. This brief article attempts to argue that any form of Christianity that is not inherently Jewish is missing the mark and subject to error. Jewish identity is not an accident of the spirit, but a necessary part of being part of the family of God.

The Offense of the Cross Further Reflections on Skandalon...
Read more >
Yeshua repeatedly took the role of a "stumbling block" to test people's response to his ministry and message. Most people were offended at Him, of course, and in the end Yeshua was crucified for the sake of their offenses.  After His death, the cross itself became the scandal of faith. The Apostle Paul referred to the "offense of the cross" which he did not want removed. But what is the "offense of the cross" and why is the proclamation of the crucified Messiah a scandal (ÏÎºá½±Î½Î´Î±Î»Î¿Î½) to Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles?
The Most Important Mitzvah The Centrality of the Gospel Message...
There are many false teachers at work today, including many who teach error in the name of the "Messianic movement."  These teachers invariably claim that something more is needed than simple faith in the truth of the gospel message. This brief article is meant to appeal to those who are confused about the nature of salvation and to refute those who falsely claim that Christians are "under the law" of Moses rather than the law of the Messiah....

Do we die to the Torah?Thoughts on the word "law" in Galatians...
Commentators of the Book of Galatians often fail to make certain critical distinctions that often lead to exegetical errors and theological confusion. Perhaps the most serious of these errors is the failure to carefully distinguish between the idea of "law" and the idea of "covenant."  It is a source of confusion to say, for instance, that we have "died to the law" (Î½á½¹Î¼á¿³ á¼Ïá½³Î¸Î±Î½Î¿Î½) without qualifying the idea of "law" to explicitly and exclusively refer to the legal subset of the terms of the covenant given at Sinai...   Read more >
Testing "Messianic" Ministries...Where is the central focus?
Because false teachers abound in the world, each of us is obligated to test (Î´Î¿ÎºÎ¹Î¼á½±Î¶Ï, lit. "determine if a metal is pure") the thinking of others to see if they are truly children of God (1 John 4:1). This is especially important regarding "Messianic" minstries that purport to be speaking the truth on behalf of the Living God....

Many rabbis think the word "Torah" refers to the subset of the writings of Moses called Sefer Ha-Brit (×¡Öµ×¤Ö¶×¨ ×Ö·×Ö¼Ö°×¨Ö´××ª) that defined the various ethical, social, and ritual obligations given in the Sinai Covenant (Exod. 24:7-8). However, claiming that the whole Torah may be reduced to the terms of the Sinai Covenant is an example of the logical "fallacy of composition," that is, inferring that something must be true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole....

Pride and ParadoxFinding God in the Ego's Ashes...

It is relatively easy for human reason to concede awareness of a transcendental power that created the universe and who is the Source of Moral reality, but it cannot fathom how such Supreme Power could be made manifest in a state of weakness, identifying with what is most broken, most perverse, and most sick in the human soul and condition. The cross of Messiah is a scandal because human pride wants to deny the reality that humanity is incurably wounded, sick and without hope apart from divine intervention....
A Few Thoughts on PrayerAttuning your heart before God...
Prayer is essentially a response to God's call for us, a kind of teshuvah (×ªÖ¼Ö°×©××Ö¼×Ö¸×), or turning (shuv) to God. God's love for us is the question, and our turning of the heart toward Him is the answer. It is not about finding the right words: "When you pray, rather let thy heart be without words than thy words be without heart" (Bunyan). Inwardly bow in awe before the throne of grace. Keep praying until you are able to let go and trust God's heart...

The AkedahAnd the Passion of Isaac...
In the Torah we read about how Abraham was asked to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac as a burnt offering on Mount Moriah.  In Jewish literature, this final test of Abraham is called the Akedah, or the "binding of Isaac." Now the question may be asked, whose sacrifice was greater, Abraham's or Isaac's?  And how does the suffering of both portray the passion of Yeshua our Mashiach?

The Role of Tradition...Legalism and Liberty as Children of God
What's the role of tradition in our lives as Messianic Jewish believers?  Are we to be "legalistic" in our observance of such matters as Shabbat, Torah reading, celebrating the holidays, and so on? Doesn't that impede the free flow of the Spirit? Why should we be tied to the Jewish calendar and ways of reckoning time?  Are we obligated to think and act this way?

Many "emergent" churches focus on entertainment, on getting "results," and being "seeker sensitive" in the attempt to "spread the gospel" message. This so-called "gospel" focuses on meeting people's practical needs rather than heeding the message of the Kingdom of Heaven and salvation. The way of Yeshua, however, is anything but pragmatic. His focus entirely turns us around.

Did Jesus Speak Hebrew?Disputing the claim of Aramaic Primacy...
Every so often I get asked the question of whether Jesus (Yeshua) really spoke Hebrew (rather than Aramaic, Greek, or even Latin).  After all, there seems to be some Aramaic words in the New Testament, and the text itself is written in Koine Greek. In this brief article, I take a look at the question.

Torah Sheb'al PehThe Oral Torah and Jewish Tradition...
During Shavuot we revisit the miracle of the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, but you might be surprised to know that Rabbinical Judaism believes that two Torahs were given to Moses at that time -- the written Torah and the oral Torah (in Kabbalistic traditions there is even a third or "hidden" Torah as revealed in the Zohar). This brief essay considers some aspects of the oral Torah and its significance to us as followers of Jesus.

Olam HaTorahJustice and Mercy will kiss...
This exploratory article raises some questions regarding whether the Torah of Moses is immutable (as is held by traditional Orthodox Judaism) or whether it is (itself) subject to overmastering purposes and plans of the Lord.  In other words, is the word "Torah" to be linked to the covenant made with the nation of Israel at Mount Sinai, or is it perhaps grounded in a deeper covenantal purpose of God that is intended to embrace all of humanity?

A Plea for Hebrew StudyEspecially for Pastors and Teachers
In this short article, John Piper attempts to cajole his fellow pastors to take their duty to study the original languages of the Scriptures seriously. I would qualify Dr. Piper's comments, however, by insisting that the study of Hebrew must take priority over the study of the Greek text of the New Testament (though of course both are important).
After all, the Greek text of the New Testament derives its authority and veracity from the Jewish Scriptures, and not the other way around.  In other words, while it's possible that the Hebrew Scriptures are true and the Greek Scriptures are not, it's impossible for the Greek Scriptures to be true if the Hebrew Scriptures are not. Too many Christian theologians go at this backwards, reading the Greek New Testament as the interpretative filter for the study of the Hebrew text. The hermeneutical primacy of the Hebrew text should be evident to all who study the Scriptures seriously.

Birthpangs of the Messiahand the End of Olam Hazeh...
Although the "world system" wants you to feel confused, perplexed, and threatened, we know there is no fear in love, since ein od milvado -- there is no real power apart from God.  Ultimately, then, the purpose of the Great Tribulation is redemptive and healing (called yissurei ahavah, "the troubles of love"), a time that the prophets foretold would give birth to innumerable children.

The Life is in the BloodNew Life and the Greater Exodus...
I was recently asked what to make of Jesus' statement, "Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you shall not have life within you" (John 6:53).

Torah Observant ReduxShould Christians Follow the Law of Moses?
Since Jesus lived as an observant Jew, and since we're called to follow Him, shouldn't we live as observant Jews as well? This question is deceptively simple yet enormously complex, as most of you know. If it resolves to the question as to whether we should study and obey the Torah as Jesus did, then the answer is yes, though of course we must be clear exactly what this means, especially in light of the collective teaching of the New Testament.

Why then the Law? Further Thoughts on the "End of the Law"...
Since parashat Ki Teitzei contains more legal commandments than any other Torah portion, it is natural that we should revisit the question of whether we are obligated to follow the lawcode of Moses or not... In light of the salvation given in Yeshua, what is our relationship to the law? What is the goal or "end" of the Law that the Apostle Paul discussed in his letters?

Some Musings about SufferingMust God immediately vanquish evil?
Why did God create the universe with both the possibility and the prevalence of suffering and evil?  Surely an all-loving, all-knowing, and all-powerful God could have created a world free from the harrowing pain that plagues us all. The question is not academic, since suffering in our lives can lead to bitterness and chronic depression.  Pointless suffering can lead to eventual madness and spiritual suicide, so it is vital to attempt to understand its function in our lives and find hope in our struggles.

Finding CourageIn the Midst of Sickness...
There are some well-meaning souls who seem to think that the life of faith in Jesus should be relatively pain-free and without the normal sorts of infirmities that affect all people.  These people seem to reason that since Jesus died on the Cross as a ransom for our sins, we should also be set free from pain and sickness of every kind. If a Christian gets sick or experiences loss in their life, then he/she must somehow be deficient either in their understanding of the power of the atonement or in the exercise of their faith.  Well, is this true?

The Triunity of GodMultiplicity in Oneness...
Many "Torah observant" teachers today seem to struggle with the idea that Jesus is none other than YHVH come "in the flesh."  Though they might accept the idea that he was the Jewish Messiah, they appear to have trouble with the idea that "God has a Son" and therefore struggle with the idea of the "Trinity" (××©××××©× ××§Ö¼×××©×) -- or the Triune nature of the Godhead.

The Heart of the LawAnd the Law of the Gospel...

In this brief article, I look at some statements that indicate both continuity and discontinuity of the Law in the teaching of Jesus.

A Taste of Pirke AvotFinding Wisdom in the Mishnah
Since I recently wrote about the role of oral Torah in Jewish thinking, I thought it would be worthwhile to look at Pirke Avot ("The Chapters of the Fathers"), a popular collection of ethical maxims found in the Mishnah (i.e., the core text of the Talmud). Though it is found in part of Seder Nezikin (a section of the Mishnah concerned with legal liabilities), some scholars believe Pirke Avot originally was intended to be a summary of the entire Mishnah itself.

A Prophet like unto meMoses' Prophecy of the Messiah
Moses foretold the coming of the Mashiach as one who would "be like me," namely, a Deliverer, Prophet, Lawgiver, Teacher, Priest, Anointed One, and a Mediator between God and man who (like Moses) would offer himself to die for the sins of the people.

Taryag Mitzvot -The 613 Commandments in Torah...
The Hebrew word mitzvah means "divine commandment" (mitzvot is the plural form).

In this article, I provide Rambam's list of 613 commandments, and offer New Testament correlations, when applicable.

Two House TheologyAre Christians the "Lost Tribes" of Israel?
The Two House Theory (or "Ephraimite Movement") thinks that "Christians" are actually members of the "lost tribes" of Israel. Based on readings from the prophets Ezekiel (Ezek. 37:15-28) and Jeremiah (Jer. 31:31), this doctrine maintains that one day the lost tribes (i.e., the church) will be reunited with the "house" of Judah (i.e., the Jews) under the terms of the New Covenant.

So you want to beTorah Observant?
Within the Messianic Community at large, there is a lot of discussion as to whether a follower of the LORD Jesus should be "Torah Observant" -- that is, obligated to follow the various mitzvot stipulated in the Sinai Covenant. In this brief essay, I look at the meaning of the word "Torah" and try to show that it is a function of (or response to) something more basic, namely, the covenantal acts of the LORD God of Israel.

Traditional Judaism regards circumcision as a "rite of passage" into covenant relationship with the LORD, a type of "giving birth" to a member of Israel, the very family of God.

But should a follower of Jesus the Messiah undergo ritual circumcision?

Faith and FearChoosing to See the Good...
Fear is the "default mode" of the soul that dwells in darkness. This is because the "fallen" soul regards the empirical world and its flux as ultimately real -- and therefore "sees in order to believe." The life of faith, on the other hand, looks beyond the realm of appearances to behold an abiding glory -- and therefore "believes in order to see."  How we choose to see is ultimately a spiritual decision for which we are each responsible....

The Wisdom of this Worldis foolishness unto God
A Hebrew word translated "folly" is kesilut, perhaps better understood as stupidity (the Greek word used is Î¼ÏÏÎ¹Î±).

Other Articles...
The following additional articles you might find helpful. Most of these are from one of my favorite authors, Soren Kierkegaard.
The Dynamics of Despairand the task of life...
An excerpt from Kierkegaard's book "The Sickness Unto Death" that provides an incisive analysis of the modes or ways we choose to embrace our existence. The self is defined as a conscious "synthesis" of the infinite/finite, the temporal/eternal, of freedom/necessity, all in relationship to God, who is the Source and End of self-conscious life. We will be in a state of "despair" when we attempt to deny any one of these paradoxes and thereby choose to understand ourselves apart from relationship with God.  We are at the "crossroads" of the eternal and the temporal, and we can only know ourselves for what we are when we surrender to God for each irrepeatable choice of our lives.

God has no Causeby Soren Kierkegaard
There are many people who are self-deceived about being on "God's side" in a disagreement or conflict. But how many people understand that God is supremely powerful, the Master of the Universe, and that all that comes to pass occurs soley on the basis of His gratuitous will alone?  He is not looking for volunteers to defend the faith or "come to His aid."  No, as SK points out, God is looking for those who are willing to "face examination," to come to the end of themselves and their supposed resources, and to "take up the cross" of Jesus.

The Road is Howby Soren Kierkegaard
Worldly wisdom is very willing to deceive by answering correctly the question, "Where is the road?" while life's true task is omitted, that spiritually understood is rather how the road is walked. Worldly sagacity teaches that the road goes over Gerizim, or over Moriah, or that it goes through some science or other, or that the road is certain doctrines, or certain behaviors. But all this is a deception, because the road is how it is walked.

The Crowdand its servants...
We warn young people against going to dens of iniquity, even out of curiosity, because no one knows what might happen. Still more terrible, however, is the danger of going along with the crowd.

The Task before usfinding the courage of our convictions...
Why is it that people prefer to be addressed in groups rather than individually? Is it because conscience is one of life's greatest inconveniences, a knife that cuts too deeply? We prefer to "be part of a group," and to "form a party," for if we are part of a group it means goodnight to conscience. We cannot be two or three, a "Miller Brothers and Company" around a conscience. No, no. The only thing the group secures is the abolition of conscience.
Read more >
Two Ways of Reflectionand their savants...
There are some people who approach spiritual truth as a subject matter to be mastered, like a schoolboy might study for world history examinations. But as Soren Kierkegaard points out, "truth" does not comprise a set of static facts that may be assimilated, nor does it promote a logical structure to the crisis of present experience. No, "subjective truth," meaning the truth for which one lives and dies, is never approached on such a basis, despite the bluster of those pretenders of knowledge who hail their own conceits on the question.
Read more >
Faith and Reason:Passion and Paradox...
For Kierkegaard, the rule of faith is necessarily antithetical to the canons of reason, since objectifying God or attempting to explain Him in strictly rational terms weakens the radical decision to "walk by faith, not by sight." In this regard, he is far more "Hebraic" in his mindset than other big-name Christian theologians....Objectivity never leads to certainty, yet our lives demand urgent, irrepeatable choices.  As SK says, "Faith is the contradiction between the infinite passion of inwardness and objective uncertainty. In other words, if I apprehend God objectively, I do not have faith; but because I cannot do this, I must have faith."  When truth is (objectively) understood as subjectivity it is called a paradox.

Alone with God's WordHermeneutical Evasions and Abulia...
Kierkegaard used the analogy of a lover's letter written in a foreign language to make the distinction between the often tedious process of translation and the act of reading from the heart... For the lover -- the one for whom the words are addressed -- all the "scholarly preliminaries" of translation are regarded as nothing more than a necessary evil to reach the goal -- that of reading and understanding the question of the lover's message.

Christ has no doctrineFaith as its own category...
"To become a Christian is the ultimate, to want to "understand" Christianity, as if it were some doctrine, is open to suspicion..." This excerpt from Soren's work "Concluding Unscientific Postscript" reminds us that the life of faith as it's own category of existence. Attempting to explain the life of faith using terms from the realm of rational discourse is a means of evading the task at hand: "Follow me..."

A Dangerous SchoolingSaving the Body but Killing the Spirit...
Only when a person suffers and wills to learn from what he suffers does he come to know something about himself and about his relationship to God. This is the sign that he is being educated for eternity. Through suffering a person can come to know a great deal about the world â how deceitful and treacherous it is â but all this knowledge is not the schooling of suffering.

Jewish Humor
Keeping your perspective...
Characteristically "Jewish" humor is a bit difficult to define. It is sometimes proud, full of naches, and joy, yet may also be marked with self-deprecation, poignancy, pathos, and irony....  As with most things Jewish, it is complex, beautiful, and mystifying.WARNING:  Please do not read the jokes in this section if you are priggish or otherwise thin-skinned! Some of the jokes you may consider to be in bad taste, though frankly your level of comfort reading these jokes will correspond to your own level of self-acceptance within the larger Jewish "mishpochah" or havurah.  NONE of the jokes listed here are meant to be interpreted in a hostile, anti-Semitic, or negative way (I am, after all, ohev Yisrael!)  For the sake of the more goyishe readers of these pages, I've included some definitions of Yiddish and Hebrew terms that might help you catch the point of the joke (just click the highlighted words you don't recognize on the page). Nu - so smile already!

Terms used on this page:
Goy: (n) Gentile; non-Jew; sometimes said disparagingly, though the Jews themselves are referred to by God as a goy kadosh (holy nation). The term goyim acherim (other nations) found in the Prophets became shortened to goyim (pl. of goy), and then by back-formation, a non-Jew was referred to as a goy.
Goyishe: (GOY-e-sheh) Gentile; Goyish; "Gentilish"; non-Jewish.
Havurah: (CHAV-oo-rah) (Hebrew, from chaver, friend) Fellowship; Association; Group with a common sense of identity or mission.
Mishpochah: (MISH-po-khah) (Hebrew; n) Family. By extension, havurah.
Naches: (NAKH-ess) (Yiddish) Proud pleasure or joy (usually over one's (grand)children).
Ohev Yisrael: (oh-hev-yees-ra-EL) (Hebrew) A lover (or friend) of Israel.
Yiddish: (n) Germanic language spoken by about four million Jews throughout the world. The name Yiddish itself means 'Jewish' and is originally short for yidish daytsh, or 'Jewish German'; an older term in English is Judaeo-German. The language arose in central Europe between the 9th and 12th centuries as an amalgam of Middle High German dialects, incorporating also many Hebrew words. Like Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish), Yiddish is generally written using an adaptation of the Hebrew alphabet. However, Yiddish itself is not linguistically related to Hebrew, despite containing a large component of Hebrew vocabulary.

THE PATRIARCH Jacob once said, מְעַט וְרָעִים הָיוּ יְמֵי שְׁנֵי חַיַּי, "few and evil have been the days of the years of my life," and so it sometimes seems for me as well.  Now Jacob was 130 years old when he spoke these words to Pharaoh, and my relatively short life span cannot begin to compare with his, but nonetheless the seemingly wayward "days of the years of my life" have likewise yielded a profoundly difficult lesson about an extraordinarily joyful subject -- namely, the unrelenting grace and irrepressible love of the Lord God of Israel, especially as revealed in the life of Yeshua (Jesus), the Jewish Messiah and Son of God.

Though this isn't the place to give you my testimony about how I experienced the miracle of teshuvah (a changed life), you should perhaps know that I studied philosophy both in college and in graduate school (I taught logic during my graduate school program), and that I also attended Seminary, twice, actually!  I have studied Koine Greek and Hebrew and lived Jewish culture for many years now, both formally and informally, and it's my hope to share some of my learning and experience with you here.
I am not a "professional" teacher of Biblical Hebrew, however, nor do I have a PhD in Semitic languages or earn my income teaching Hebrew at a seminary.  No, despite taking various classes in the subject (at Talmud Torah and other places), I have worked my way through the language over the years, attempting to live out its implications (that is absolutely essential), and trusting in the Lord to reveal to me the spiritual meaning of His word.  After all, language (even divinely inspired language) is ultimately a means to something else, and it is that other thing that we must seek.  τὸ γὰρ γράμμα ἀποκτέννει, τὸ δὲ πνεῦμα ζῳοποιεῖ:  "for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life" (2 Cor 3:6).  May you find that Eternal Life (חַיֵּי עוֹלָם) that is forever speaking the word of hope!A few other things about me might be in order here.  I have been writing the monthly "Hebrew Lesson" column for the Zola Levitt Ministries newsletter for nearly 20 years now (though this ministry is not directly associated with ZLM). In case you are interested in reading these, you click here to receive them FREE of charge.
I have been affiliated with some Messianic congregations and churches in the Twin Cities, but we currently fellowship in a home assembly that meets every week for Shabbat. We are considering starting a grace-based Messianic chavurah (fellowship) in the Twin Cities area, if God so wills...
My wife's name is Olga, and we had our first child, Josiah Yisroel, on October 7th, 2004, our second, Judah Abraham, on March 31st, 2009, and our third, Emanuel David on January 17, 2016.  Both Olga and my three sons have been further gifts of the unsearchable chesed and love of God to me.
So why this site?
This web site is intended to provide a resource to the Church regarding its rich Hebraic heritage by promoting Jewish literacy among all those who claim Jesus Christ as their Lord.  I believe this is important today for many reasons, but especially because many people in the church today are unaware of the inherent Jewishness of their heritage, and sadly this reflects in many misinterpretations regarding the Scriptures. Remember: Jesus was (and is) a Jew, and to be a follower of Him implies learning about the Jewish people -- their culture, their language, and their way of understanding the Scriptures. Moreover, in the olam habah, the world to come, we will all give homage to a Jewish Lord and Jewish Savior! Why not get a head start and begin learning the "language of the kingdom?"Studying biblical Hebrew and your Jewish heritage will give you the correct context for reading the B'rit Chadashah (New Testament) by equipping you to comprehend the implications of the Tanakh (Old Testament). You will begin to better understand the Hebraic mindset that informs all the New Testament writings, avoiding exegetical errors that distort the original intent of the authors of the Holy Scriptures.To help you get started, explore the literally thousands of pages on this web site. You might also want to take a look at the book I wrote for Zola Levitt Ministries entitled, Zola's Introduction to Hebrew (also called Ivrit Lematchilim). I have looked at dozens of Hebrew "primers," but I earnestly believe that this resource is the best available for Christian adults to begin learning about the mystery and beauty of the Hebrew language.  To further your education of the Jewish roots of your faith, please consider my more recent book, A Year Through the Torah.  (Additional books are forthcoming, if it pleases God.)Above all, my hope is that this effort of mine will bless you and help you in some way. As I alluded to at the top of this page, my life has been a difficult journey in the way of trusting in the love of G-d as revealed in the face of Jesus (2 Cor 4:6). Nevertheless, my sojourn here has repeatedly revealed to me the L-rd G-d of Israel is faithful and good, and I sincerely pray that you will find great comfort and encouragement as you attend to those things that matter most in your own sojourn here on earth.
Tips for Using this Site
With literally thousands of pages of information on this site, you might feel a bit overwhelmed and a bit unsure where to begin.  For people new to the study of Hebrew and the Jewish roots of their faith, I would first of all recommend studying my two books: the Introduction to Hebrew text and then A Year Through the Torah.  These books actually complement one another, since what you learn in the Hebrew book will apply to your studies of Torah.  The Hebrew book is excellent for both homeschooling as well as adult learning, and I provide audio files, flash card downloads, and other materials to help you learn the language.  I would furthermore supplement these studies with regular visits to the Hebrew4Christians site update pages where I regularly add relevant information about the Jewish holidays, the Torah reading for the week -- and how all this applies to our lives as Christians.
Please Consider Supporting this Work
Hebrew4Christians is neither affiliated with nor supported by other organizations.  We are not part of a church denomination, a school, a Jewish educational service, or any other group, and therefore we receive no financial assistance other than through occasional book sales and the tzedakah of some faithful supporters.  Of course operating this way is challenging, but it also frees us to offer content that is unique and not predetermined by denominational biases or other agendas.  As an independent ministry, Hebrew4Christians addresses vital theological concerns that most traditional churches (and synagogues) ignore while remaining free to engage in self-questioning and honest exploration of the Scriptures. And unlike some other "Messianic" ministries out there, we remain entirely grace-based, meaning that we do not subscribe to legalism or rituals as the expression of our faith in the finished work of Yeshua for our salvation.If you believe in the vision of Hebrew for Christians and find the content to be helpful, please prayerfully considering supporting us.  We must "fight the good fight of faith" -- especially in these days of increasing spiritual darkness -- and we can't do this without your help!  Thank you, chaverim!

Entries are listed alphabetically according to transliteration. Phonetic representations will use hyphens to separate the syllables. The accented syllable will be indicated with CAPS. Parts of speech are given in abbreviated form (e.g., n. for noun, adj. for adjective, and so on). Common English spellings are sometimes provided in the definition. If relevant, English Bible (KJV) scripture references are provided in parentheses. Sample Entry:
Abba
(AHB-bah) Aramaic. n.  Abba. "Daddy," "dear Father," "papa"; a term of endearment for one's father (Mark 14:26; Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6). Abba is a more intimate expression than the normal Hebrew word for "father" (av). Note that the dagesh in the Bet is forte since it is preceded by a vowel.
Locating EntriesSince entries are listed according to English transliteration rather than Hebrew script, locating an entry must be based on transliterated values. To find an entry, keep the following points in mind:
For words that begin with Aleph or Ayin, the entry will be listed under the vowel sound associated with the letter (e.g., adon, elohim, igeret, ohel, and ulpan).
For words that begin with Vet or Vav, check under V.
For words that begin with Chet, check under Ch.
For words that begin with Tet or Tav, check under T.
For words that begin with Kaf, check under K.
For words that begin Samekh or Sin, check under S.
For words that begin with Tsade, check Ts.
For words that begin with Qof, check either Q or K.
Note: Letters with a dagesh forte double their consonantal value but are often not so represented in conventional English transliterations. In general, this glossary follows the more common transliteration as used by North American Jews.Vowel SoundsFor English transliterations (as opposed to phonetic representations listed in parentheses), Hebrew vowel sounds will be represented with the following letters:The sheva will be transliterated using an apostrophe or "e" when it is vocal. Consonant SoundsThe Hebrew consonants are represented using standard English letters. The following exceptions, however, should be noted:Aleph and Ayin are often left untransliterated and are indicated by the vowel sound associated with them. Jewish Literacy: 51 Words of ValueWords and definitions mean little apart from their historical and cultural context.  In order to understand the meaning of a word, it's always good idea to understand both its history (etymology) and also its usage over the millennia.  To expedite your level of literacy, I include Hebrew words/phrases that represent some Jewish values (middot halev).Biblical Hebrew VocabularySeparate pages are provided for Hebrew words based on frequency of occurrence in the Tanakh. These words should be written down on flash cards and memorized as part of your ongoing study of Hebrew grammar.Navigation TipFor any page in the glossary section you can return to this page by simply clicking on the banner at the top of the page.

The Treasure of Hebrew Idioms is a booklet/CD that gives you insight into the 500 most important "crown jewels" of Hebrew idioms! Sources include the Bible, Talmud, Mishnah, Gemarah, Midrash, literature and poetry.

Kabbalah Sites
Warning: Kabbalah (or Jewish mysticism) is fundamentally opposed to the idea of salvation through Yeshua alone.  It claims that human nature is essentially a part of god and that the matter of salvation is to become like god through removing the "kellipot." This is not the salvation message that Yeshua came to bring, nor does it exalt the sacrifice of Yeshua as the means for obtaining eternal kapparah (atonement) with the Father.  Nonetheless, the study of Kabbalah is important for those who wish to study Jewish culture and history. Chabad.org - A Lubavitch web site that promotes kabbalistic mysticism and monistic theosophy.

A Year Through the Torah Book/CD
Transform your understanding of Scripture...
A Year Through the Torah
A Week-by-Week Journey for Christians*
The deepest links between Christianity and its Jewish origins -- clearly revealed and reconnected!
You can read dozens of "Old Testament" commentaries and not learn a fraction of what this single volume presents...
LARGE PAGE SIZE FORMAT!Audio CD Included!
320 pages with an 80 minute audio CD for the Biblical Hebrew text used in the book; includes the Hebrew Names of G-d and Hebrew terms!
Ideal for students of Biblical Hebrew!
Centuries before Jesus walked the earth, Ezra the Scribe divided the first five books of the Bible -- the Torah -- into 54 portions so that in the course of a year the entire scroll would be recited during services. This practice is still observed in synagogues around the world today. Jesus said that these Scriptures plainly testify of Him:
"And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself" (Luke 24:27).
Now you can better understand just how these Scriptures bear witness that Jesus is the promised Messiah of Israel by studying the weekly Torah portion for yourself! Using this book, you will:
Understand the Jewish calendar and the Jewish Scripture reading schedule
Gain deeper insights between the older and new Covenant Scriptures
See how Jesus (Yeshua) is clearly revealed in the Old Covenant Scriptures
Reinforce your appreciation of Scripture by reading it using the Hebraic mindset
Learn Jewish literacy and interpretation principles
Practice your Hebrew reading by listening to the Hebrew text recited by a native Israeli speaker
With a Year Through the Torah, now Christians and Messianic Jews can restore Torah study as the exegetical foundation for their New Testament studies.
- Mark Levitt, Zola Levitt Ministries
Each chapter, covering a single Torah portion, features a wealth resources, including selections of Torah text (with transliterations) as well as portions from the Prophets and New Testament. Throughout, careful attention is taken to demonstrate how Yeshua (Jesus) is powerfully revealed in the Jewish Scriptures. * Note: You don't have to begin with Genesis to start this book!  You can "tune in" any time you want!
Recently David Biema of Time Magazine wrote a fascinating article entitled "Future Revolutions" in which he identified the "Re-Judaizing of Jesus" as one of the top ten cultural trends of the 21st Century. Understanding the Jewish context of Jesus is becoming more and more essential for the next generation of Christians in the world today.Perhaps the single most powerful way to understand the Jewish context of Jesus is to study the Jewish Scriptures themselves, namely, the Law (Torah), Writings and Prophets. This was Jesus' own approach with his disciples: "And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself" (Luke 24:27).

Rethinking our cultural assumptions -- particularly how they are expressed in the institutional churches of our time -- is a hard but necessary work. An excellent way to begin, however, is by "retooling" our theological lexicon so that we are better able to contextualize and understand the message of Yeshua and his disciples. This book will challenge you.  It's not intended to serve up "spiritual popcorn" for casual consumption. Because it presents the Scriptures from a Jewish perspective, the demand on the reader is fairly high -- and your theological assumptions will be tested.
I think we ought to read only books that bite and sting us. If the book we are reading doesn't shake us awake like a blow on the skull, why bother reading it in the first place?  A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us.  - Franz Kafka
Experience supplies painful proof that traditions once called into being are first called useful, then they become necessary. At last they are too often made idols, and all must bow down to them or be punished. - J. C. Ryle
If Christianity is to receive a rejuvenation it must be by other means than any now being used. If the church...is to recover from the injuries she suffered, there must appear a new type of preacher. The proper, ruler-of-the-synagogue type will never do. Neither will the priestly type of man who carries out his duties, takes his pay and asks no questions, nor the smooth-talking pastoral type who knows how to make the Christian religion acceptable to everyone. All these have been tried and found wanting. Another kind of religious leader must arise among us. He must be of the old prophet type, a man who has seen visions of God and has heard a voice from the Throne. When he comes (and I pray God there will not be one but many) he will stand in flat contradiction to everything our smirking, smooth civilization holds dear. He will contradict, denounce and protest in the name of God and will earn the hatred and opposition of a large segment of Christendom. - A.W. Tozer

A Year Through the Torah Book/CD
Transform your understanding of Scripture...
A Year Through the Torah
A Week-by-Week Journey for Christians*
The deepest links between Christianity and its Jewish origins -- clearly revealed and reconnected!
You can read dozens of "Old Testament" commentaries and not learn a fraction of what this single volume presents...
LARGE PAGE SIZE FORMAT!Audio CD Included!
320 pages with an 80 minute audio CD for the Biblical Hebrew text used in the book; includes the Hebrew Names of G-d and Hebrew terms!
Ideal for students of Biblical Hebrew!
Centuries before Jesus walked the earth, Ezra the Scribe divided the first five books of the Bible -- the Torah -- into 54 portions so that in the course of a year the entire scroll would be recited during services. This practice is still observed in synagogues around the world today. Jesus said that these Scriptures plainly testify of Him:
"And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself" (Luke 24:27).
Now you can better understand just how these Scriptures bear witness that Jesus is the promised Messiah of Israel by studying the weekly Torah portion for yourself! Using this book, you will:
Understand the Jewish calendar and the Jewish Scripture reading schedule
Gain deeper insights between the older and new Covenant Scriptures
See how Jesus (Yeshua) is clearly revealed in the Old Covenant Scriptures
Reinforce your appreciation of Scripture by reading it using the Hebraic mindset
Learn Jewish literacy and interpretation principles
Practice your Hebrew reading by listening to the Hebrew text recited by a native Israeli speaker
With a Year Through the Torah, now Christians and Messianic Jews can restore Torah study as the exegetical foundation for their New Testament studies.
- Mark Levitt, Zola Levitt Ministries
Each chapter, covering a single Torah portion, features a wealth resources, including selections of Torah text (with transliterations) as well as portions from the Prophets and New Testament. Throughout, careful attention is taken to demonstrate how Yeshua (Jesus) is powerfully revealed in the Jewish Scriptures. * Note: You don't have to begin with Genesis to start this book!  You can "tune in" any time you want!
Recently David Biema of Time Magazine wrote a fascinating article entitled "Future Revolutions" in which he identified the "Re-Judaizing of Jesus" as one of the top ten cultural trends of the 21st Century. Understanding the Jewish context of Jesus is becoming more and more essential for the next generation of Christians in the world today.Perhaps the single most powerful way to understand the Jewish context of Jesus is to study the Jewish Scriptures themselves, namely, the Law (Torah), Writings and Prophets. This was Jesus' own approach with his disciples: "And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself" (Luke 24:27).
Serious students of the Scriptures will not want to miss this life-transforming study!

A dying world
People who have DIEDsince this page loaded:
The vision for this web site is to provide a resource for the Church regarding its rich Hebraic heritage by promoting Jewish literacy among all those who claim Jesus Christ as their Lord.  I believe this is important today for many reasons, but especially because many people in the church today are unaware of the inherent Jewishness of their heritage, and sadly this reflects in many misinterpretations regarding the Scriptures. Remember: Jesus was (and is) a Jew, and to be a follower of Him implies learning about the Jewish people -- their culture, their language, and their way of understanding the Scriptures. Moreover, in the olam habah, the world to come, we will all give homage to a Jewish Lord and Jewish Savior! Why not get a head start and begin learning the "language of the kingdom?"Studying biblical Hebrew and Jewish heritage will give you the correct context for reading the B'rit Chadashah (New Testament) by equipping you to comprehend the implications of the Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim (the Tanakh or Old Testament). You will begin to better understand the Hebraic mindset that informs the New Testament and to avoid exegetical errors that distort the original intent of the authors of the Holy Scriptures.Kindly note: The material on this site is my own personal work.

The Great Exodus from Egypt...
Last week's Torah portion (Va'era) reported how Pharaoh refused to listen to Moses' pleas for Israel's freedom, despite seven devastating plagues that came upon Egypt in God's Name (יהוה). In this week's portion (Bo), the battle between God and Pharaoh comes to a dramatic conclusion. The last three of the ten plagues are unleashed upon Egypt: a swarm of locusts devoured all the crops and greenery; a palpable darkness enveloped the land for three days and nights; and all the firstborn of Egypt were killed at the stroke of midnight of the 15th of the month of Nisan...Before the final plague, God instructed the Jewish people to establish a new calendar based on the sighting of the new moon of spring. On the tenth day of that month, God told the people to acquire a "Passover offering" to Him, namely an unblemished lamb (or goat), one for each household. On the 14th of that month ("between the evenings") the animal would be slaughtered and its blood sprinkled on the doorposts and lintel of every Israelite home, so that God would "pass over" these dwellings when He came to kill the Egyptian firstborn that night. The roasted meat of the offering was to be eaten that night with unleavened bread (matzah) and bitter herbs (maror). God then commanded the Israelites to observe a seven-day "festival of matzah" to commemorate the Exodus for all subsequent generations. Just before the last plague was delivered, however, God instructed the Israelites to ask their Egyptian neighbors for gold, silver and jewelry, thereby plundering Egypt of its wealth. The death of the firstborn at last broke Pharaoh's resistance and he finally allowed the Israelites to depart. Because they left in great haste there was no time for their dough to rise. The Torah states that there were 600,000 adult men who left Egypt, along with the women, children, and a "mixed multitude" of other Egyptian slaves who tagged along.The Israelites were commanded to consecrate all the firstborn to God and to commemorate the anniversary of the Exodus each year by celebrating the LORD's Passover in conjunction with the Feast of Unleavened Bread. During this time they were to remove all leaven from their homes for seven days, eat matzah, and retell the story of their redemption to their children. The portion ends with the commandment to wear tefillin (phylacteries) on the arm and head as a reminder of how the LORD saved the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt.

International Holocaust Remembrance Day
On January 27, 1945, the largest of the Nazi death camps (Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland) was liberated by Soviet troops. In October 2005, the UN General Assembly designated this date as "International Holocaust Remembrance Day" (IHRD) to commemorate and honor the victims of the Nazi era. Note that the UN-sponsored date is not the same thing as Yom HaShoah, which occurs in the spring (Nisan 27).The systematic genocide of the Jewish people is one of the most heinous and barbarous crimes in the history of humanity. Reflecting on the atrocities should lead each of us to be vigilant to protect the individual liberties of all people at the hands of the State.  Any political ideology or religious creed that elevates the interest of the "collective" over the sanctity of the individual is therefore inherently suspect. Note:  For more information about IHRD, see this page.
Blessing before Torah Study:
Some terms:
Parashah is the weekly Scripture portion taken from the Torah. Each parashah is given a name and is usually referred to as "parashat - name" (e.g., parashat Noach). For more information about weekly readings, click here.
Aliyot refer to a smaller sections of the weekly parashah that are assigned to people of the congregation for public reading during the Torah Reading service. In most congregations it is customary for the person "called up" to recite a blessing for the Torah before and after the assigned section is recited by the cantor. For Shabbat services, there are seven aliyot (and a concluding portion called a maftir). The person who is called to make aliyah is referred to as an oleh (olah, if female).
Maftir refers to the last Torah aliyah of the Torah chanting service (normally a brief repetition of the 7th aliyah, though on holidays the Maftir portion usually focuses on the Holiday as described in the Torah).  The person who recites the Maftir blessing also recites the blessing over the Haftarah portion.
Haftarah refers to an additional portion from the Nevi'im (Prophets) read after the weekly Torah portion. The person who made the maftir blessing also recites the blessing for the Haftarah, and may even read the Haftarah before the congregation.
Brit Chadashah refers to New Testament readings which are added to the traditional Torah Reading cycle. Often blessings over the Brit Chadashah are recited before and after the readings.
Mei Ketuvim refers to a portion read from the Ketuvim, or writings in the Tanakh. Readings from the Ketuvim are usually reserved for Jewish holidays at the synagogue.
Perek Yomi Tehillim refers to the daily portion of psalms (mizmorim) recited so that the entire book of Psalms (Tehillim) is read through in a month. For a schedule, of daily Psalm readings, click here.
Gelilah refers to the tying up and covering the Sefer Torah (Torah Scroll) as an honor in the synagogue.
Divrei Torah ("words of Torah") refers to a commentary, a sermon, or devotional on the Torah portion of the week.

Some Encouragement for your Hebrew Studies
Signs and Wonders...
The Hebrew word for "letter" is ot (××Ö¹×ª), which can also mean "sign" or "wonder." Each letter of the Aleph-Bet, then, may contain signs that point to wonderful truths about life.According to midrash, the LORD God Himself taught the alphabet (along with the numerical values, mathematical relationships, etc. for the letters) to Adam ha-rishon, who then transmitted this knowledge to his sons, and they passed this to their sons, and so on, until it was taught to Jacob at the School of Shem in Salem (later renamed Jerusalem). Jacob taught the secrets of the alphabet to Joseph, who used it to decipher dreams, etc.  The Jewish mystics go so far as to say that the entire cosmos was created from the 22 consonants of the Hebrew Aleph Bet, called otiyot yesod (××Ö¹×ª×Ö¼×Ö¹×ª ×Ö°×¡×Ö¹×) or "foundational letters." Through the otiyot yesod God formed substance out of chaos and brought forth existence from nonexistence. In other words, the entire universe is created and sustained by divine language (the Word of God). When the LORD spoke the universe into existence, His words still echo throughout all of creation, sustaining it and preserving it in being.
Rabbi Oshaya taught: When a human king builds a palace, he does not build it with his skill alone; the king employs a builder. Moreover, the builder does not bring it out of his own imagination, but consults a blueprint - a plan and diagram - to know how to arrange the chambers, doors, and passageways of the palace. In the same way, God as both King and Builder consulted Torah and then created the world. - Midrash Genesis Rabbah 1:1
Yeshua the Mashiach is called devar Elohim (×Ö¼Ö°×Ö·×¨ ×Ö±××Ö´××), the Word of God, and the Aleph and Tav (×Ö¸×Ö¶×£ ×Ö°×ªÖ¸×), Who upholds all of the created order by the word of His power. It is the Mashiach Yeshua alone Who is the true yesod (×Ö°×¡×Ö¹×) or foundation of life itself. Every holy utterance can be traced back to Him, and He is the Source and Origin of all that is good, lasting, and righteous. Indeed, Yeshua is called "the zohar of His glory" (××Ö¼× ××Ö·×¨ ×Ö¼Ö°××Ö¹××Ö¹), that is, the radiance of the glory of God Himself, who "upholds all things by the word of His power" (× ×Ö¹×©×Öµ× ×× ×Ö¼Ö´×Ö°×Ö·×¨ ×Ö¼Ö°××Ö¼×¨Ö¸×ª×Ö¹) (see Heb. 1:3). Since He is the First and the Last, we can see that the otiyot will all reveal something about Him.As various acrostics in Scripture reveal, the Hebrew letters and their order are of divine origin. The Hebrew language is unique in this regard, since you can learn something about God from the Hebrew letters themselves and their spiritual properties. For instance, some claim that the order of the letters within a word reveals spiritual properties. For example, if the letters appear in a word in ascending order (i.e., from Tav -> Aleph), the word connotes compassion (i.e., moving toward Aleph/God), whereas if they appear in a reversed or descending order (i.e. from Aleph -> Tav), the word connotes the idea of justice. An example of the former would be the Name "Yah" (×Ö¸×Ö¼) and of the latter, the word "king" (×Ö¶×Ö¶×Ö°). Other words are formed in "triangular" patterns, combinations of these attributes, etc.
A Blessing for learning Hebrew
The following blessing may be recited thanking the LORD for teaching your hand to write the letters of the Hebrew aleph-bet:
Barukh ha'melamed et yadi le'sapper et ha'otiyot.
Blessed is the One who has taught my handto scribe the letters!
Hebrew Script Styles and STA"M
There are a variety of Hebrew script styles used today, though the Hebrew script used for sacred writing is called STA"M (an acronym for Sifrei Torah (Torah scrolls), Tefillin (phylacteries), and Mezuzot). STA"M is written using Ketav Ashurit (Aramaic square script) according to a number of detailed rules of how each letter is to be formed.There are three basic types of STA"M writing performed by STA"M certified Jewish soferim (scribes):
Bet Yosef - Ketav Yosef is the style of Hebrew script used by Ashkenazi Jews. Its source derives from the Gemara and Rabbi Yosef Caro - author of the Bet Yosef and Shulchan Aruch:(This is the style used on this website when displaying the STA"M letters).
Bet Ari - Ketav Ari is the Hebrew Script written in accordance to the tradition of Rabbi Isaac Luria, 1534-1572 (also known as the Arizal). In Europe most Chassidim use this script for their Sifrei Torah. Notice that it is identical to the ketav Yosef except for the letters Aleph, Vav, Chet, Tsade, Tsade Sofit, and Shin, which have slight modifications:
Sefardi - This style of Hebrew script is used by Sephardic Jews:
In each case of script style, however, there are many rules governing the formation of the letters (collectively known as soferut) so that there be no confusion between the letters written in the sacred writings.

Some Encouragement for your Hebrew Studies
Signs and Wonders...
The Hebrew word for "letter" is ot (××Ö¹×ª), which can also mean "sign" or "wonder." Each letter of the Aleph-Bet, then, may contain signs that point to wonderful truths about life.According to midrash, the LORD God Himself taught the alphabet (along with the numerical values, mathematical relationships, etc. for the letters) to Adam ha-rishon, who then transmitted this knowledge to his sons, and they passed this to their sons, and so on, until it was taught to Jacob at the School of Shem in Salem (later renamed Jerusalem). Jacob taught the secrets of the alphabet to Joseph, who used it to decipher dreams, etc.  The Jewish mystics go so far as to say that the entire cosmos was created from the 22 consonants of the Hebrew Aleph Bet, called otiyot yesod (××Ö¹×ª×Ö¼×Ö¹×ª ×Ö°×¡×Ö¹×) or "foundational letters." Through the otiyot yesod God formed substance out of chaos and brought forth existence from nonexistence. In other words, the entire universe is created and sustained by divine language (the Word of God). When the LORD spoke the universe into existence, His words still echo throughout all of creation, sustaining it and preserving it in being.
Rabbi Oshaya taught: When a human king builds a palace, he does not build it with his skill alone; the king employs a builder. Moreover, the builder does not bring it out of his own imagination, but consults a blueprint - a plan and diagram - to know how to arrange the chambers, doors, and passageways of the palace. In the same way, God as both King and Builder consulted Torah and then created the world. - Midrash Genesis Rabbah 1:1
Yeshua the Mashiach is called devar Elohim (×Ö¼Ö°×Ö·×¨ ×Ö±××Ö´××), the Word of God, and the Aleph and Tav (×Ö¸×Ö¶×£ ×Ö°×ªÖ¸×), Who upholds all of the created order by the word of His power. It is the Mashiach Yeshua alone Who is the true yesod (×Ö°×¡×Ö¹×) or foundation of life itself. Every holy utterance can be traced back to Him, and He is the Source and Origin of all that is good, lasting, and righteous. Indeed, Yeshua is called "the zohar of His glory" (××Ö¼× ××Ö·×¨ ×Ö¼Ö°××Ö¹××Ö¹), that is, the radiance of the glory of God Himself, who "upholds all things by the word of His power" (× ×Ö¹×©×Öµ× ×× ×Ö¼Ö´×Ö°×Ö·×¨ ×Ö¼Ö°××Ö¼×¨Ö¸×ª×Ö¹) (see Heb. 1:3). Since He is the First and the Last, we can see that the otiyot will all reveal something about Him.As various acrostics in Scripture reveal, the Hebrew letters and their order are of divine origin. The Hebrew language is unique in this regard, since you can learn something about God from the Hebrew letters themselves and their spiritual properties. For instance, some claim that the order of the letters within a word reveals spiritual properties. For example, if the letters appear in a word in ascending order (i.e., from Tav -> Aleph), the word connotes compassion (i.e., moving toward Aleph/God), whereas if they appear in a reversed or descending order (i.e. from Aleph -> Tav), the word connotes the idea of justice. An example of the former would be the Name "Yah" (×Ö¸×Ö¼) and of the latter, the word "king" (×Ö¶×Ö¶×Ö°). Other words are formed in "triangular" patterns, combinations of these attributes, etc.
A Blessing for learning Hebrew
The following blessing may be recited thanking the LORD for teaching your hand to write the letters of the Hebrew aleph-bet:
Barukh ha'melamed et yadi le'sapper et ha'otiyot.
Blessed is the One who has taught my handto scribe the letters!
